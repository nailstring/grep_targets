The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa
constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography,
history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a
magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number
One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is
tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over all
parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can
distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the
course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been
concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen
them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them.
