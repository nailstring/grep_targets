This is a sample text file.
You can use grep to search for specific patterns in this file.
grep is a powerful tool for text processing.
It can find and display lines that match a given pattern.
This file is just an example, but you can create and search larger files as well.
grep can be used with regular expressions to perform more complex searches.
Have fun experimenting with grep!
